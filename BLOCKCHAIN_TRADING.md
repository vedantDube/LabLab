# CarbonTwin Blockchain Trading Implementation

## Overview

CarbonTwin features a comprehensive blockchain-based carbon credit trading system built on Ethereum, providing full transparency, immutability, and automated verification through smart contracts.

## Smart Contract Features (CarbonTracker.sol)

### Core Functionality

- **Carbon Credit Minting**: Create new carbon credits with certification
- **Peer-to-Peer Trading**: Direct trading between wallet addresses
- **Emission Reporting**: On-chain emission data with verification
- **Digital Twin Integration**: Blockchain-based facility modeling
- **Automated Verification**: Smart contract-based validation

### Key Components

#### 1. Carbon Credit Structure

```solidity
struct CarbonCredit {
    uint256 id;
    address owner;
    uint256 amount; // in tons CO2
    uint256 pricePerTon; // in wei
    string certificationHash;
    string projectDetails;
    bool retired;
    uint256 vintage; // Year of carbon reduction
    CreditType creditType;
}
```

#### 2. Trading Functions

- `mintCarbonCredit()`: Create new carbon credits
- `tradeCarbonCredit()`: Execute trades with automatic payment
- `retireCarbonCredit()`: Permanently remove credits from circulation
- `getOwnedCredits()`: View user's portfolio

#### 3. Credit Types
